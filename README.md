Big Sorting Algorithm Project

Full disclosure: Some of the code is collaborative and/or provided by Professor. If memory serves me right, TimedSorting was entirely provided by the Professor. Part of DataIO and Main were provided as well.

The gist of this project is summed up in a report that I will add as well.
